# codex agent guide (project)

This repo follows the rules in `AGENTS.md`. Read that file first.

Quick reminders
- mac-only target; android `.backup` only.
- read-only UI; no network calls by default.
- no GPL code/tools, no shelling out to external tools.
- follow `docs/implementation-plan.md` milestones in order.
- if backup format fields are unknown, store them in `metadata_json` and continue best-effort.
